This is a program and some test data to combine 2 HURDAT2 files from the National Hurricane Center with one IBTrACS file from teh national Climatic Data Center to create one large data set of all tropical storm tracks from approximately 1942 up to the present.

In addition, the program should create 1) a single Shapefiles for each storm with just one line for the storm, with overall atrributes for that storm (max intensity, etc.) another Shapefile for each storm with all segments having the attributes for that segment. 

Data from these programs will be used to update the NOAA Office for Coastal Managment Historical Hurricane Tracks web site:
coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes
